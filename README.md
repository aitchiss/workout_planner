# workout_planner

I created this Android app during the CodeClan 16 week Software Development course, after one week of Java study, and 4 days of familiarisation with Android Studio.

The app reflects my own interests, and the brief I developed for the project was as follows:

```
You are needed to design an Android mobile application that will allow the user to create custom strength-training workout plans, 'play' through these workouts at the gym, and save their progress in a history.

MVP:

- Be able to create a custom workout plan, saved in history with a name
- Be able to add and remove sets to a workout plan
- The app should have pre-programmed activities, but also accept custom inputs
- Be able to go through a workout while at the gym, viewing and editing progress set by set
- Be able to save an accurate record of workout performance and view it in a history

```

### My approach

I started the project by producing a class diagram outlining the structure for the app. I also created a Trello board, breaking the project down into MOSCOW requirements, where I tracked progress throughout the project.

Initial design ideas were worked up using MockFlow and sketches of the app's planned activity flow.

### The final product

The app was fully completed within the one week timeframe, and meets all of the MVP requirements. 

Particular strengths in the final app:

- Validation of user inputs to prevent unexpected crashes
- Streamlined design style with calls to action clearly identifiable
- Additional features added to enhance user experience, including ability to add or delete similar sets from the workout overview screen, and ability to skip a set with one click, rather than manually inputting 0reps, 0kg.
